Hi Kari,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Naitik Shah, and I’m currently a Data Scientist Co-op with DTE Energy’s Data Analytics team under the guidance of Paolo Mora, Bipin Maddineni, and Leena Khiani. Bipin recommended I reach out to you as my Co-op term concludes on December 12, and I’m eager to explore opportunities where I can continue contributing as a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, or Business Analyst through Strategic Staffing Solutions.

At DTE, I’ve developed a strong foundation in data science, supporting impactful projects that have streamlined operations and enhanced decision-making. By implementing data validation workflows, optimizing SQL queries, and constructing predictive models, I’ve contributed to a 25% reduction in call volume and a 15% cut in financial losses due to fraud. My expertise in Python, SQL, Databricks, and Power BI—combined with my experience in NLP and forecasting—aligns with various data-centric roles, and I’m confident that my skills would add value to your client base.

I’ve attached my resume for your reference, and I’d love to discuss how my background might align with Strategic Staffing Solutions' needs. Please let me know if you’d be available for a conversation, or if there's a specific application process you recommend.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Naitik Shah
