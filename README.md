# Energy Anomaly Detection using LSTM

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in energy consumption patterns using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal is to identify irregularities in energy usage to support efficient resource allocation, mitigate potential fraud, and improve operational reliability.

The implementation leverages LSTM's ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it ideal for time-series anomaly detection tasks.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handles missing data, outlier removal, and normalization of energy usage metrics.
   - Converts raw data into sequences suitable for LSTM training.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Constructs and trains an LSTM model on the preprocessed time-series data.
   - Incorporates techniques like dropout and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Analyzes deviations between predicted and actual energy consumption.
   - Flags instances with significant errors as potential anomalies.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Calculates precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance.
   - Visualizes results to highlight anomalies within consumption trends.
